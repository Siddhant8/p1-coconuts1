## Project Plan General Summary and Description of Parts ##

Summary: 
	Our project involves creating the GUI of a tea shop, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation. To contain everything in a single window, we will need card panels ← ask Kevin and Nakul. The purpose is to simulate a tea shop.

## Scrum Board + Short Summary of Completed Goals##

[Issues Link Showing Each Person's Code](https://github.com/Siddhant8/p1-coconuts1/issues/1) NOTE: our github links are located within this issue page
<br/><br/>Andrew Hale Completed Items: Make React based UI and program for Tea Shop Menu. Create game for TeaShop. Host program using Netlify.
<br/><br/>Siddhant Ranka Completed Items:Created a coronavirus case calculator that calculates the number of coronavirus cases based on inputs of population, mask-wearers, initial case numbers, and the day.
<br/><br/>Aidan Rosen Completed Items: finalized JukeBox to include multiple "Cassettes", clickable buttons built from txt-file stored URLs. Built with an ArrayList that uses data across the MVC (txt file in model, pass strings within txt file to control, iterate through strings in UI). 

## How to Run Our Code ##
First click on the MainMenu configuration and run MainMenu. This is a picture of what the MainMenu will look like:

### NOTE!
This site is only built for ONE viewport. It might look weird on your computer. In the future I would like to style the site better but right now I am not focused on making the site look pretty. I am more focused on making it usable.

### [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/AndrewH06/teashop) 
The GitHub is seperate because Netlify hosts based on a GitHub Repository. This means I must have a React App on its own Git so it must be seperate.

## Delivery Plans and Content: ## 

Fridays - 
Update Scrum Board with what has been completed and what is in progress. README will include links of code that each person wrote with a brief description of each person’s work for the week. Self-evaluations and scrum evaluations will be included if assigned. We will decide our plans each week based on how the work is going.

Midterm - 
The midterm deliverable will consist of a GUI that has a button leading to a tea shop. The tea shop will then have a button pointing to a coronavirus map and a button pointing to a shopping area. The shopping area will serve a selection of teas and flavors. 

The Night at the Museum - 
A full tea shop will be in place. A UI will simulate moving through a cafe/store.
