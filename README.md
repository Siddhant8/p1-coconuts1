## Project Plan General Summary and Description of Parts ##

Summary: 
	Our project involves creating the GUI of a tea shop, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation. To contain everything in a single window, we will need card panels ← ask Kevin and Nakul. The purpose is to simulate a tea shop.

## How to Run Our Code ##
Coronavirus Tracker - The first textfield is where someone inputs the total number of people in their simulated population. Once someone adds the number of people in the first text field click on the first button to send the number of people into the simulation. The second textfield is the field to input the initial number of people wearing masks. Click the second button after inputting the initial number of people wearing masks. The third textfield is the input for the initial number of cases that started the outbreak in this simulation. Click the third button after inputting this number into the textfield. Finally, the fourth textfield is where the number of days is inputted and the fourth button is clicked right after.

## Delivery Plans and Content: ## 

Fridays - 
Update Scrum Board with what has been completed and what is in progress. README will include links of code that each person wrote with a brief description of each person’s work for the week. Self-evaluations and scrum evaluations will be included if assigned. We will decide our plans each week based on how the work is going.

Midterm - 
The midterm deliverable will consist of a GUI that has a button leading to a tea shop. The tea shop will then have a button pointing to a coronavirus map and a button pointing to a shopping area. The shopping area will serve a selection of teas and flavors. 

The Night at the Museum - 
A full tea shop will be in place. A UI will simulate moving through a cafe/store.
