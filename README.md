# README for p1-coconuts #

## Project Plan General Summary and Description of Parts ##

Summary: 
	Our project involves creating the GUI of a tea shop, and interacting with the tea shop in various ways. These “various ways” would be a jukebox, or ordering a beverage, or a coronavirus case tracker in the area (just to name a few). Some of these would be independent due to simplicity, but could also involve collaboration to blow them up in proportion. For example, the coronavirus tracker may start out as just a text box but then be blown up into an animation. To contain everything in a single window, we will need card panels ← ask Kevin and Nakul. The purpose is to simulate a tea shop.


## Delivery Plans and Content: ## 

Fridays - 
Update Scrum Board with what has been completed and what is in progress. README will include links of code that each person wrote with a brief description of each person’s work for the week. Self-evaluations and scrum evaluations will be included if assigned. We will decide our plans each week based on how the work is going.

Midterm - 
The midterm deliverable will consist of a GUI that has a button leading to a tea shop. The tea shop will then have a button pointing to a coronavirus map and a button pointing to a shopping area. The shopping area will serve a selection of teas and flavors. 

The Night at the Museum - 
A full tea shop will be in place. A UI will simulate moving through a cafe/store.
